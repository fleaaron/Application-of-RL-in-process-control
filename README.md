## Application of RL in process control
The code for my thesis work with the title Application of Reinforcement learning algorithms in process control

This repository has three jupyter files:
- Tank level control with Deep Q Learning (the model of the liquid container tank was modeled in python, then DQL agent was implemented to control the liquid level in the tank)
- Tank level control with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (the same as the previous case, but this time DDPG algorithm was used for the same purpose)
- Temperature control with DDPG in HYSYS environment (DDPG agent was used to control the temperature of an industrial vapor-liquid separator vessel, which was model by using Aspen HYSYS 
  process simulation software)
